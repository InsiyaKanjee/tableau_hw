## Insights from Page 1

### Relationship between Covid Cases and Ridership
- In June 2021, NYC had the lowest number of Covid cases at 5,115. During this time the ridership was highest at around 3.1M .
- While as Covid cases increased in July and August, the ridership decreased. 
- Therefore, it seems like there is some negative correlation between biking and Covid Cases, even though biking is majorly an outdoor activity.

### Relationship between Ridership and Month
- As weather transitioned to hotter months, the ridership increased.
- Hotter months also has higher average trip duration, while colder months has lower average drip duration.

### Some caveats
- 2021 was a unique year and it would be valuable to compare average trip duration broken down by months for other years (2019 or 2018) to make a conclusion about whether biking is seasonal or this trend was mostly due to Covid

### Popular Starting and Ending Stations
- Over all Station E 17 St & Broadway was the most popular starting and ending station for riders
- If data is looked at closer, the most popular station changes month over month, for example in June West St and Chamber St is the most popular station

### Relationship between Hour of Day and Number of Trips
- Over all 5pm to 6pm looks like the most popular biking time, however on saturday there is a wider spread and times between 11am to 6pm are very popular.


### Relationship between Rideable Type and Month
- Docked bikes were popular from Feb to June but July to August the classic bikes became more popular. Electric bikes had very low ridership across entire time period.

### Relationship between Member Type and Month
- Members made up higher levels of % during covid and winter months, while casual bikers increased in % as cases reduced and weather got warmer. 

### Relationship between Member Type and Avg Trip Time
